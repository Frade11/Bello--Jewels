## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frade11/Bello--Jewels.git
2. Open index.html in your preferred browser.

3. Explore the website — products, cart, and interactive elements work locally.


## 💡 Implementation Notes  

- Product data is stored in a **JavaScript array**, making it easy to expand or update the catalog.  
- The shopping cart persists using **LocalStorage**, ensuring data remains after page reloads.  
- Modals and the carousel are built with **vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks).  
- The project simulates a **realistic front-end e-commerce flow** without a backend.
